<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The name of Ivanhoe was suggested by an old rhyme. All novelists have had occasion at some time or other to wish with Falstaff, that they knew where a commodity of good names was to be had. On such an occasion the author chanced to call to memory a rhyme recording three names of the manors forfeited by the ancestor of the celebrated Hampden, for striking the Black Prince a blow with his racket, when they quarrelled at tennis: </p><p>"Tring, Wing, and Ivanhoe, For striking of a blow, Hampden did forego, And glad he could escape so."</p><p>The word suited the author's purpose in two material respects,â€”for, first, it had an ancient English sound; and secondly, it conveyed no indication whatever of the nature of the story. He presumes to hold this last quality to be of no small importance. </p></div> </div>
