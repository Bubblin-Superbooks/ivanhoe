He was comely in countenance, bulky and strong in person, and in the flower of his ageâ€”yet inanimate in expression, dull-eyed, heavy-browed, inactive and sluggish in all his motions, and so slow in resolution, that the soubriquet of one of his ancestors was conferred upon him, and he was very generally called Athelstane the Unready. </p></div> </div>
