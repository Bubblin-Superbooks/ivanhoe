The Knight bowed low and gracefully, but returned no answer. </p><p>While the trumpets sounded, while the heralds strained their voices in proclaiming honour to the brave and glory to the victorâ€”while ladies waved their silken kerchiefs and embroidered veils, and while all ranks joined in a clamorous shout of exultation, the marshals conducted the Disinherited Knight across the lists to the foot of that throne of honour which was occupied by the Lady Rowena. </p></div> </div>
