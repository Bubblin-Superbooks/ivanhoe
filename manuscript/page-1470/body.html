It should be remembered, however, that heraldry had only its first rude origin during the crusades, and that all the minutiae of its fantastic science were the work of time, and introduced at a much later period. </p><p>Additional Note</p><p>In corroboration of said note, it may be observed, that the arms, which were assumed by Godfrey of Boulogne himself, after the conquest of Jerusalem, was a cross counter patent cantoned with four little crosses or, upon a field azure, displaying thus metal upon metal. </p><p> The heralds have tried to explain this undeniable fact in different modesâ€”but Ferne gallantly contends, that a prince of Godfrey's qualities should not be bound by the ordinary rules.</p></div> </div>
